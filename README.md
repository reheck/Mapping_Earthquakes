# Mapping_Earthquakes
## Purpose
### This activity was to learn to use GeoJSON to pull in data from a websource and turn it into a JSON object with a specific format for all the geographical data. Making an API call to MapBox to utilize their map styles allowed for professional maps to be built as base layers with the GeoJSON data as selectable layers to add onto a chosen base. JavaScript was again used along with CSS to script functions to perform on the GeoJSON data and format the information displayed on the map layers.
